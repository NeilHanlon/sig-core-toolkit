While not considered a "stack", it's a combination of many things at once. So
it is being tested as a stack.

We will be testing mainly against EL8. It is not clear if EL9 will keep idm as
a module in 9. However, certain tests will be checking for the release just in
case that the modules will disappear. (I can only hope that it does and that
it just goes back to what Fedora is doing and what EL7 does). -label
